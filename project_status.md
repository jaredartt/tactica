# Crown Nemesis — project status

**Last updated:** 2026-09-11
**Read this first if you are a fresh Claude session picking up this project.**

This file is the handoff document. It is the canonical one — it lives in the
repo and is versioned with the code. Keep it current: when you finish a chunk
of work, update the "Where things stand" and "Backlog" sections before the
session ends.

## 1. What this is

A competitive 1v1 turn-based tactics card game.

| | |
|---|---|
| Live | https://jaredartt.github.io/tactica/ |
| Repo | `github.com/jaredartt/tactica` (branch `main`) |
| Front end | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, no UI framework, hand-written CSS |
| Back end | Supabase (Postgres + RLS + Realtime + Auth) |
| Deploy | GitHub Pages, via `./deploy.sh` |
| Owner | Jared (jaredartt@gmail.com) — solo dev, also draws all the art |

### Architecture in one paragraph

**The server is the authority.** There is no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policy on
`matches`. Every mutation goes through a `SECURITY DEFINER` plpgsql function.
The client is a renderer that calls RPCs. This is deliberate and must not be
eroded — if you find yourself wanting the client to compute a game outcome,
you are about to introduce a cheat.

Rules and authorisation are split: `cn_move` / `cn_attack` hold the rules and
take an explicit `p_side`; `submit_move` / `submit_attack` are thin shells that
work out who you are and call them. **The bot calls the same `cn_*` functions**,
so it is bound by every rule a player is, and a rule change moves it too.

---

## 2. How to work on this repo

### Where the files are

The work happens **on Jared's machine**, through the device bridge, at:

```
$HOME/mnt/Documents/tactica          # via mcp__remote-devices__device_bash
```

Edit files there in place with `device_bash` (python read-modify-write, or
`sed -i`). **Never re-type a file's contents from earlier tool output** — it may
have been truncated. Only stage files into the cloud container when you need
the Postgres harness or Playwright.

### Deploy

```bash
cd ~/Documents/tactica
TACTICA_REMOTE="https://x-access-token:$(cat ~/.ghtok)@github.com/jaredartt/tactica.git" ./deploy.sh
```

`deploy.sh` builds to a `mktemp -d` on purpose: Vite cannot unlink stale assets
inside the synced folder. For a plain type/build check use:

```bash
npx tsc -b && npx vite build --outDir "$(mktemp -d)" --emptyOutDir
```

### Moving files onto the device

`device_commit_files` to a path that ALREADY EXISTS in the synced folder does
not always land -- it reports success and the old bytes stay. It bit twice in
one session: a rebuilt `mksite.py` and a rebuilt `src.tgz` both silently kept
their previous contents, and the second one cost a full build-and-measure round
against code that had not changed. **Commit to a NEW filename every time**
(`src-cards.tgz`, `src-cards2.tgz`) and check the md5 on the device before
trusting it. The same folder cannot unlink, which is the likely cause and is
also why `tar x` over an existing tree fails with "File exists" -- extract to
`$HOME/tmpsrc` outside the mount and `cp -R` in, which truncates in place.

### The git lock dance

`rm` fails inside the synced Documents folder, so git's lock files cannot be
removed normally. Before **every** git command:

```bash
mkdir -p .git/_stale && mv .git/*.lock .git/_stale/ 2>/dev/null
```

Files you need to delete go to `_to_delete/` (already gitignored) — or ask for
delete permission via `device_request_delete_permission`.

### The SQL test harness (cloud container)

```bash
export PGBIN=/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin
su pg -c "$PGBIN/pg_ctl -D /home/claude/pgdata -o \"-k /home/claude/pgsock -p 5455 -c listen_addresses=''\" -l /tmp/pg.log -w start"
cd /home/claude/cn && ./t.sh 01_rules.sql 02_presence.sql 03_ladder.sql 04_roster.sql \
                             05_idle.sql 06_bot_ranked.sql 07_abilities.sql 08_profile.sql
```

`sync.sh` copies staged migrations/tests in; `reset.sh` rebuilds the database.
Postgres must run as the `pg` user, not root. Stage files first with
`device_stage_files` so `/mnt/user-data/uploads/Documents/tactica/...` is fresh.

**Current: 681 assertions, all green.** `09_combat.sql` is the Phase A file;
`10_board.sql` is Phase B's, `11_swings.sql` and `12_clock.sql` are
Phase C's, and `13_settings.sql`, `14_ability_es.sql`, `15_kingdoms.sql`,
`16_admin.sql` and `17_trio.sql` are Phase D's, and `18_ranked_blind.sql`
is a bug fix of its own, and `19_tournaments.sql` is Phase E's. Run the whole thing with `./supabase/tests/run.sh`.

**A test that passes on luck is a test that fails on luck.** `12_clock.sql` was
flaky at about one run in two, and had been since the day it was written:
`t_match()` lays eight trees at RANDOM, and the "a move does not touch the
clock" step walks a unit from (2,2) to (3,2) -- which fails outright whenever a
tree happened to be standing there. `09_combat.sql` clears the trees for
exactly this reason; `12_clock.sql` never did. One line, `t_trees(:'m','[]')`,
and six runs out of six. Worth checking in any new file that calls `t_match()`
and then moves anything.

That script has now had **three** silent-failure bugs, which is worth saying out
loud: if a test run ever looks too quiet, suspect the runner before you suspect
the tests.

1. It created no database while `_helpers.sql` pinned its GUCs with
   `alter database t`, and every psql sent stderr to /dev/null -- so the run
   died with no message at all.
2. It globbed `0[1-9]*`, which would have skipped `10_board.sql` without a
   word, and a skipped file looks exactly like a passing one.
3. The capture line had no `|| true`. With `set -e` and `pipefail`, psql
   exiting non-zero on the first failed assertion killed the script *inside the
   command substitution* -- before the `echo` that prints what it captured. A
   failing file printed its own name and then nothing, and the run ended with
   no verdict. This is how `12_clock.sql` appeared to contain no assertions
   while it was in fact failing one. Fixed.

Parry and crit are 5% rolls, so the suite pins them the way it pins the coin
flip: `cn.force_parry` and `cn.force_crit` are set to `'never'` on the test
database in `_helpers.sql`, and a section that wants one turns it on with
`set cn.force_parry = 'always'` and resets it after. A unit at 0% or 100% is
not rolling at all, so the hatch does not reach it -- that is how one test
stands a non-parrying unit up in a forced-parry board.

### The one rule that matters most

> **Verify by measurement, not by eye.**

Every layout or visual claim gets checked in headless Chromium
(`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`) with real numbers — element rects, computed
styles, `elementFromPoint`. Two of the worst bugs in this project's history
(the board collapsing to zero height, the unit info box shoving the map) were
invisible to reasoning and obvious to a measurement. Where a bug is subtle,
write the test so it **fails on the old code first** — a test that passes on
both versions proves nothing.

### Measuring the client (Playwright)

npm cannot reach the registry from the cloud container (403 on
`registry.npmjs.org`) and Chromium is not on the device, so neither machine can
do this alone. The arrangement that works:

1. Build a harness **on the device**, where `node_modules` already is. A harness
   is an entry that mounts one component with a fabricated `MatchState`.
2. Stage the built html/js/css into the container, serve them with
   `python3 -m http.server`, and drive it with python Playwright against
   `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome` -- note the version in
   that path, there is no plain `chromium/` directory.
3. Measure PIXELS: element rects and the board's own tile pitch, never the grid
   styles the component wrote, because the style is the thing under test.

#### Build it WITHOUT a bundler -- `_to_delete/h/mksite.py`

Do not rely on `vite build` for a harness. `node_modules` is inside the synced
folder and therefore **shared between a Mac and a Linux VM**, while rollup and
esbuild each ship a native binary per platform. An `npm install` run on the Mac
prunes it to darwin binaries, and the VM can then run neither -- `Cannot find
module '@rollup/rollup-linux-arm64-gnu'`, and `Exec format error` from esbuild.
This has happened once already and will happen again on any `npm install`.

`tsc` is pure JavaScript and always works, so the harness is built from tsc
output instead. `_to_delete/h/mksite.py` (gone with `_to_delete`; rebuild it
from this description) does three small jobs:

1. tsc emits `from '../lib/cine'`; a browser needs `../lib/cine.js`.
2. tsc emits `import '../styles.css'`, which is not a module -- strip it and
   `<link>` the stylesheet in the page. Also replace `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`,
   which is Vite's and undefined anywhere else.
3. `react`, `react/jsx-runtime` and `react-dom/client` are bare specifiers. Load
   React's UMD builds from `node_modules/react*/umd/` as plain scripts and point
   an **import map** at three shims that re-export the globals. Read the shim's
   export list off the installed React with
   `node -e "Object.keys(require('react'))"` rather than writing it by hand -- a
   hand-written list is wrong the first time a dependency imports a hook nobody
   thought of, which is exactly how it failed once, on `useSyncExternalStore`.

**React 19 ships no UMD build**, so job 3 needs a second path and mksite.py now
has one: wrap each CommonJS file in a factory, register it under its own name,
and give them a `require` that resolves among themselves -- about thirty lines,
no native binary, and every React ships CJS. It picks UMD when the files are
there and CJS when they are not, and **prints which**, because "the harness ran
against a different React from the app" should never have to be deduced from a
symptom. This matters on a machine that has React 19 installed globally and no
way to `npm install` React 18 (the cloud container's registry access is
restricted), which is exactly where this came up.

The Supabase shim is no longer inert either. It records every `rpc` call on
`window.__RPC` and answers from `window.__RPC_REPLY`, so a test can assert what
WENT OUT as well as what came back -- which for Kingdoms is most of the point.

To restore the native binaries instead, on the Mac:
`npm install --no-save --force @rollup/rollup-linux-arm64-gnu@$(node -p "require('rollup/package.json').version") @esbuild/linux-arm64@$(node -p "require('esbuild/package.json').version")`.
`--force` is needed because npm's `--cpu`/`--os` filter dependencies but still
platform-check a package you name directly.

The Kingdoms slice was checked with 131 (`kingharness.tsx` + `kcheck.cjs`,
`lobbyharness.tsx` + `lcheck.cjs`), against nine mutants rather than against
the old code -- see Phase D below for why and for the list. The card slice
added 78 more (`cardharness.tsx` + `ccheck.cjs`), and those DO run against the
previous commit, where 48 of them fail; the purple words took that file to 124
and added 116 in node (`kwcheck.cjs`); the admin editor took the lobby suite
from 25 to 68. **294 browser assertions and 116 in node**, all told.

**The Supabase shim in `mksite.py` is a small fake server now**, not an inert
stub: it records every rpc, insert, update and storage upload on `window.__DB`,
answers from `window.__RPC_REPLY`, can be made to refuse with
`window.__DB_ERR`, and -- since the card editor needed it -- actually APPLIES
`.eq()` filters rather than handing the same rows to every caller. Most of what
is worth asserting about an editor is which calls went out, not what was
drawn.

Phase C's client was checked with 85 browser assertions (the takeover, the
beats and their captions, the reductions that are named and the ones that are
not, a parry chain where every flash has to be a fresh element, the falling,
skipping, phone widths, reduce-motion, and the queue and the bot hold from
inside `Board`) plus 400 random fights in node. Note that most of it is NEW
surface, so "run it against the old code first" does not apply the way it did
in Phase B -- there was nothing there to regress.

Phase B's client was checked this way -- 109 browser assertions over the flip,
the tints, the half line, the whole menu flow, the budget gates, the pips, the
movement arrow and the opponent's ghost, at 320 / 390 / 768 / 1280 px. Every one
was also run against the previous commit's files first, where they fail. That is
the only thing that proves they are testing anything.

**Not everything needs a browser.** Two things were better checked in node, by
bundling a test with the local esbuild (`node_modules/.bin/esbuild x.ts --bundle
--platform=node --format=cjs`; anything that reaches `supabase.ts` needs
`--define:import.meta.env='{...}'` or it dies on a missing env var at import):

- `pathTo()` against `reachable()` over 400 random boards, 19,200 tiles: every
  route starts on the unit, ends on the tile, steps one square at a time, and
  stands only on tiles `reachable()` agrees with. This is the check that keeps
  the arrow honest.
- The ghost's throttle, on a hand-cranked clock. Worth doing: reading it back
  is what found a real bug, where the dedupe key was stringified WITH the side
  attached on one side of the comparison and without it on the other, so the
  two never matched and every pointer move went down the wire. The rate limiter
  is now `throttler()`, exported from `useGhost.ts` with its clock and its
  timers injected, precisely so it can be tested without a browser.

The harnesses lived in `_to_delete/` and are gone; the recipes above are what to
rebuild them from.

### Security constraints (non-negotiable)

- **Never** handle or enter the Supabase database password.
- **Never** put a `service_role` or secret key in `.env.local` or the repo. The
  `sb_publishable_` anon key is public by design and is fine.
- Do not create accounts or enter passwords on Jared's behalf.
- Jared has given blanket consent for GitHub operations and for using his
  computer. You do not need to ask before pushing or committing.

## 3. Where things stand

### Shipped and live

Profile icons + settings panel, UI sounds, reduce-motion, battle sound effects
(11 synthesised sounds — WebAudio, no files), plus everything before that.

### Pushed and live

`afc4f7f`, `c93311a`, `595b32d`, `4c80f8f`, `c74c47d`, `6e0d9b0` are on
`origin/main`. Jared pushed the last two himself on 2026-09-11.

**Pushing from a session is still blocked, and the shape of the block has
changed.** The cloud container can now READ the repo -- `git ls-remote` and
`git clone` over HTTPS both work -- but a push is refused by the git proxy with
`jaredartt/tactica is not in this session's authorized repository set`. That is
a policy denial and not a credentials problem: the repo is rejected before any
credential is read, so it lands identically with a token and with none. The
device sandbox still gets a proxy 403 on CONNECT and cannot reach GitHub at all.
Two tokens were pasted into chat in earlier sessions trying to solve this and
neither could; both should be treated as burned and rotated.

So the working arrangement is: a session commits, Jared pushes. To lift it, add
the repo to the session's sources. (A session CAN move a commit to where Jared
can push it without going through GitHub: `git bundle create` on the device,
stage the bundle, fetch it in the container. That is how `c74c47d` was checked
against origin.)

**Still not deployed.** `./deploy.sh` force-pushes `gh-pages` and hits the same
wall, so it has to be run from an ordinary terminal.

### What those four commits contain

**`afc4f7f` — "Quick fixes: the blank rematch page, a top bar that stays, and
the roster"**

GitHub was unreachable from the device sandbox (proxy 403 on every attempt,
after having worked earlier the same session). Retry the deploy command above.
It contains:

- **The blank white page on practice rematch — fixed.** Not a crash. Match's
  navigation effect depended on `onGoTo`, which App rebuilt every render, so it
  re-ran every render — and Match re-renders 5×/second off its own clock. Each
  run restarted the wipe, whose swap lands at 310ms, so the swap never ran: the
  white block covered the screen forever. Three independent fixes (stable
  `useCallback` identities, a `wentTo` ref, and `cross()` no longer restarting
  its clock). Regression test reproduces the old failure and passes on the new.
- Top bar (`CROWN NEMESIS` + avatar + name + gear) fixed above all menu layers,
  visible and **interactive** inside every section. Height is `--head-h`.
- My Team → **My Kingdom**. Hover panel now covers the whole rhomboid
  (`inset: 0 -17%` to match the counter-skew). No more phantom all-hovered grid
  on mobile.
- Tokens: blue halo gone; rim is black on both sides and drawn as an **inset
  shadow** rather than a border (that is what closed the white corner slivers —
  a real border gives the art a different inner radius); `border-radius: 11%`;
  no tilt on hover. Move tiles pulse, no centre dot.
- Face picker: captions removed, avatars 80px.
- PWA icon grey gradient: `background_color`/`theme_color` were **already**
  `#ffffff`, so that was not the cause. Chrome had no `maskable` icon and the
  PNGs carry transparency, so it composited them onto its own background. Added
  opaque `icon-maskable-512/192.png` with the mark inside the centre 78%.

### Migrations

`0001`–`0018` are applied in production. Jared ran `0017` and `0018` on
2026-09-11, so the coin flip below is live and the host no longer always opens.

`0019_board_and_actions.sql` is **run in production** as of 2026-09-11, so the
8-tall board, the two-activation turn, Defend and Wait are all live.

`0020_swings.sql` and `0021_cinematic_clock.sql` are **run in production** as of
2026-09-11, so the blow-by-blow record and the paused turn clock are both live.

`0022_settings.sql` is **run in production** as of 2026-09-11.

`0023_ability_es.sql` is **run in production** as of 2026-09-11, so every
live card carries its ability in both languages.

`0024_kingdoms.sql` is **run in production** as of 2026-09-11, so ten kingdoms
are live.

`0025_admin.sql` is **run in production** as of 2026-09-12, and Jared's own
row has `is_admin`, so the card editor is live.

`0026_trio_and_ladder.sql` is **run in production** as of 2026-09-12.

**`0027_blind_ranked.sql` is built and tested (`18_ranked_blind.sql`) but NOT
yet run in production. It is a LIVE BUG FIX and should go out on its own.**

`0017` is confirmed run, so who opens is now a coin flip in every mode.

`0017` makes who moves first a coin flip in **every** mode (was: host always
first; `0012` only randomised the ranked *seat*). It is spliced from `0008`
rather than rewritten, because `cn_set_ready` is what turns two hidden
half-boards into one live game. `cn.first_side` is the test escape hatch,
pinned per-database in `_helpers.sql`. Measured fair: 149/300.

## 4. Decisions already made (do not re-litigate)

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Turn structure | **Pokémon-style.** Player A plays, then player B, and *that* is one turn. `turnNumber` increments after both have played. |
| Counters | Only when the defender **can reach the attacker**. A Range 3 mage shooting from 3 tiles takes no counter from a Range 1 knight. |
| Range shape | **Everything within N tiles, Chebyshev** (diagonals count as 1). Range 2 = every tile 1–2 away, corners included. Single number, no more min–max spans. |
| Build order | Quick fixes → battle rewrite → Fire Emblem animation layer → i18n + dark mode + kingdoms → tournaments last. |
| Translations | **Split.** UI strings in repo JSON (versioned, zero DB reads, code-splittable). Card ability text in the **database** — otherwise every balance tweak needs a deploy, which defeats the live card editor. |
| Card art hosting | **Supabase Storage**, uploaded from the admin panel. Not GitHub-direct: that needs a write token in a public client bundle. Store the **full URL** in `cards.art_url` / `cards.token_url`, never a bare filename — then switching hosts later is a column update, not a rewrite. |
| Deleting cards | **Retire** (`is_active = false`), not hard delete. `deck_of()` already falls back for retired cards, and a real delete would orphan finished matches. |
| Altea Twins | **Dropped for now.** No stat block was ever provided. |
| Battlefield background art | **Dropped for now.** Never attached. |

### Art already identified

- Braided girl in white → **Dorme**
- Crowned figure (pink line art) → **King Stelaris**
- Black-and-white flame character → **the placeholder** (for Velmor, Sarrave, Thalgrim, Nyxara, Zephyra, etc.)
- Effect icons: blue shield = **Defend**, gold sparkles = **Stunned**, purple spiral = **Poisoned**, red = **Burned**

---

## 5. Backlog — the big battle rework

Jared's spec. Phased in the agreed order. **Nothing below is started.**

### Phase A — combat core (SQL) — **DONE, in `0018_combat_core.sql`**

Built, tested (`09_combat.sql`), and waiting to be pasted into the Supabase SQL
editor. Not yet run in production. What it does:

- Counter **always** happens when attacked and the defender can reach back,
  for **50%** of the counter-attacker's roll. Halving it is what let it become
  automatic: trading blows is now the normal shape of a fight rather than a
  punishment for attacking into reach.
- **5% parry** on any attack: blocks it completely, then answers for 50% if the
  parrier can reach what it caught. Parries chain, **capped at 8 swings**
  (`cn_parry_cap()`), which is the only thing that can reach the cap.
- **5% crit**, +50%, on attacks, counters, and post-parry counters.
- Passives cannot be parried. Lium's answer-first is a passive and lands
  through a parry for that reason.
- Damage is a **single number ±5**: `cards.power` is the stat, `dmin`/`dmax`
  are derived from it and are now just the dice. The client prints the single
  number via `unitPower()`, which falls back to the middle of the old band for
  a match that was already in flight when this landed.
- Heals never crit, are never parried, never draw a counter.
- **Damage order**, confirmed by Jared and implemented once in `cn_damage()`:
  base roll → ×1.5 crit → ×0.5 counter → ×(1 + attacker bonuses) →
  ×(1 − defender resists) → ×0.5 if defending → round. Bonuses multiply before
  resists so a 20% bonus and a 20% resist do not cancel exactly. `p_bonus`,
  `p_resist` and `p_defending` are the hooks Phase B and the royal passives
  hang on — nothing passes anything but zero yet.
- **Losing your royal loses the match**, with four of your units still
  standing if that is how it falls.
- **Exactly one royal per kingdom** (Jared's answer), enforced in `set_deck`,
  and `deck_of` falls back to the default for a deck saved before the rule
  existed. `random_deck()` draws the bot's five under the same rule.

Left for the roster rework, and deliberately: **Dereo is the only royal on the
board**, so "exactly one" is a forced pick today. Queen Miah and King Stelaris
need art before they can be added, and the rule had to exist first or every
deck saved in the meantime would be illegal the day they land. Lium keeps his
old answer-first passive *and* gains the doubled rates and parries-all-parries
the spec gives him; the roster rework should split those apart and move
answer-first to Dorme, where it belongs.

### Phase B — turn and board

**Phase B is DONE, both halves.** The server half is `0019_board_and_actions.sql`
(`10_board.sql`, 35 assertions), run in production on 2026-09-11. The client
half is `6e0d9b0` plus the arrow and the ghost below.

Done in `0019`:

- **A turn is two activations.** One activation is one unit's whole go — move,
  then strike, or either alone — and each unit gets at most one per turn, so a
  turn is two *different* units doing something real. Jared's answers: move +
  strike is ONE go, and a unit cannot go twice. The opening player's first turn
  is one activation, not two.
- `cn_begin_act` is the only place the budget is charged, so `cn_move`,
  `cn_attack` and `cn_defend` cannot disagree about what a go costs. State
  carries `acts` (spent this turn) and `active` (the unit mid-go); units carry
  `spent`. Matches already in flight read all three through `coalesce`.
- **Defend**: `submit_defend` raises a guard that halves incoming damage until
  that unit's own next turn — so it is still up while the opponent swings, which
  is the only time it could matter. It costs an activation and ends it. This is
  the first thing to pass `cn_damage`'s `p_defending` anything but false; the
  hook has been sitting there unused since 0018.
- **Wait**: `submit_wait` closes an activation for a unit that moved and does
  not want to strike. Without it a go stays open and the menu has no Cancel.
- "End turn" already worked at any time and still does.
- Board → **8 tall × 6 wide**. The halves are rows again: host holds 0–3, guest
  4–7. Nothing is rotated in the database — the CLIENT flips per player, which
  is the part still to build. `cn_own_side` was dropped and recreated rather
  than replaced, because its parameters now mean y and h (the same reason 0011
  dropped `cn_own_half`).
- **4 trees per side**, none on either home row — which subsumes the
  no-corners rule, since every corner sits in a home row. `10_board.sql` rolls
  the generator a hundred times rather than once, because the placement is
  random and a rule that holds for one layout and not the next is the bug worth
  catching.
- **The bot plays by it.** It always *was* bound — it calls the same `cn_*`
  functions and they refused it — but `bot_step` kept proposing a third action
  until the server raised, which is how 06 and 07 found this. It now skips spent
  units and, once the budget is gone, considers only the unit already mid-go.

**The client half is DONE too.** Three things landed:

- **The action menu.** Clicking one of your units opens Move / Attack / Ability
  / Defend / (Wait) / Cancel on the piece itself, and NOTHING is lit until you
  choose. That last part is the real change: the board used to light the move
  tiles and the crosshairs the instant you selected a unit, which made a tile
  and a target look like alternatives when they are two halves of one go.
  Ability is present and disabled -- leaving the slot out until abilities exist
  would move the other four items under the player's thumb on the day they land.
  Wait appears only for the unit already mid-go, because `submit_wait` takes no
  unit and ends whichever one the SERVER has open. Walking does not close the
  menu: it comes straight back, standing where the unit now stands, with Move
  greyed and the rest still there.
- **The board flip**, in `draw()` / `flipFor()` in `rules.ts`. Here is the part
  that reads backwards until you check the rows: it is the **HOST** who flips,
  not the guest. `cn_own_side` gives the host rows 0-3, so drawn straight the
  host is along the TOP and the guest is already at the bottom where they
  belong. A spectator flips nothing, and the tinted half is therefore always the
  NEAR half rather than "yours" -- which is the honest reading for somebody who
  has no side. It is a half turn and not a mirror: flipping only the rows would
  leave left and right alone, and a spearman advancing up the right of the board
  for one player would be advancing up the left of it for the other.
  Two places convert a coordinate for the screen -- `Board.tsx`, and the hovered
  tree's card in `Match.tsx` -- and both go through `flipFor()`, which is why
  the rule is named rather than written out twice.
- **The goes**, as two rhomboid pips in the turn bar beside the clock, plus the
  count in the hint under the board. One pip on the opening turn, because that
  turn really does have one activation. Nothing on screen used to say this, so
  the server's refusal was the first you heard of the rule.

Also: `spent` and `defending` reach the token. A spent unit greys out -- the
PICTURE greys, not the whole token, or the shield on a defending unit would be
invisible on every unit it matters for -- and a raised guard shows a shield in
the upper left, stacking rightward past the burn icon the way the roster spec
asks for.

**Order of operations, and it matters: `0019` has to be run in production BEFORE
this client is deployed.** The client reads `acts` / `active` / `spent`, calls
`submit_defend` and `submit_wait`, and reads the halves as rows. On a database
still at `0018` those two functions do not exist and the board is still 8 wide
by 6 tall, so Defend and Wait would error and the tints would be drawn across
the wrong axis.

And the last two client pieces, which finish Phase B:

- **The movement arrow.** `pathTo()` in `rules.ts` is `reachable()`'s walk again
  with a predecessor kept for each tile, so the two cannot disagree about where
  a unit may go -- the arrow is a promise about a click and the server keeps or
  breaks it using those rules. Breadth first, so the first route to a tile is a
  shortest one. A flier gets the straight hop, because it is not walking.
  It is drawn Fire Emblem's way: **one piece of arrow per tile**, each an
  ordinary grid item in its own cell, built as "in-edge to middle to out-edge"
  so the straight, the corner, the tail and the shaft of the head are all the
  same two lines with different ends. No pixel arithmetic anywhere -- which is
  deliberate, since screen-rectangle maths is what broke FLIP and the board
  height before. It shows only while Move is the open question.
- **The opponent's pointer**, in `useGhost.ts`. A Realtime BROADCAST channel,
  no database, no migration. Three small fields travel -- the tile under their
  pointer, the unit they picked up, and which menu item they are on -- and the
  receiving client RECOMPUTES the highlights from the shared state with the
  same `reachable()` / `targetsFor()` everything else uses. Sending tiles would
  be more bytes and would go stale in flight.
  Its security model is that none of it is a fact about the game: a cheater can
  lie about where their mouse is, and the prize is that you get a wrong idea
  about where their mouse is. **What must never reach it** is the part to keep
  an eye on, and there are two things: it does not run during **deployment**
  (the half-boards are deliberately unreadable to each other, and a pointer
  would give a setup away one square at a time), and when Mist lands a Rogue
  aiming from inside it must go quiet -- `mute` is the argument waiting for
  that. It is also off against the bot, which has no pointer.

Nothing of Phase B is left.

### Phase C — the battle cinematic

**Phase C is DONE.** The server half is `0020_swings.sql` and
`0021_cinematic_clock.sql` (`11_swings.sql` 38 assertions, `12_clock.sql` 18),
both run in production on 2026-09-11. The client half is `cine.ts` and
`Duel.tsx`.

Jared's two answers that shaped this: the cinematic is a **full takeover** of
the screen, and **the turn clock is paused for it**. There is no off switch for
now -- a full/quick/off setting was offered and deferred to Phase D with the
rest of the settings work.

What `0020` does, and what it deliberately does not: it changes **no rule**.
Not one number is computed differently and no branch is taken differently --
which is why `09_combat.sql` and `10_board.sql` still pass untouched at 63 and
35. All it does is write down what `cn_attack` was already deciding and
throwing away.

The problem it solves is that `fx` reported **sums**, and sums cannot be
un-added. `dmg 30, counter 45, parries 2, chain 4` has many different fights
behind it, and a cinematic built on a guess about which one would narrate blows
that never landed. So the swings are kept in the order they happened and go out
on `fx.swings`. A swing is:

| field | |
|---|---|
| `k` | `hit` / `parry` / `burn` / `down` / `heal` |
| `by`, `at` | unit ids (a tree's id where the target is a tree) |
| `dmg` | what it took off |
| `crit` | the 5% roll came up |
| `counter` | it was an answer, so it was halved |
| `def` | the receiver had a guard up, so it was halved again |
| `first` | it landed BEFORE the blow it answers — Quick Dagger, and only that |
| `why` | `strike` / `counter` / `quick` / `tree` / `mend`, or for a parry `roll` / `all` |

`why` on a parry is the one worth keeping: Lium catching an answer because he
is Lium is not the same event as a 5% roll coming up, and a caption that calls
both of them "parries" is labelling rather than narrating.

`cn_attack` in `0020` is `0019`'s definition with the recording spliced in,
copied out programmatically rather than retyped -- 330 lines of combat rules is
not where to find out whether the `deploy_unit` lesson took.

The test file also pinned down two things worth writing down, because both read
like bugs until you follow the rules through:

- **Lium's catch earns him a free blow.** Catching an answer is a parry, a
  parry answers if the parrier can reach what it caught, and he is standing
  next to it -- so the shape is `hit, parry, hit`, three swings, and the third
  is his. It lands in `riposte`, not `counter`.
- A killed unit leaves the board for good, so the section that kills somebody
  has to kill a unit no later section needs. `09_combat.sql` already had to
  learn this; `11_swings.sql` now does the same thing for the same reason.

### What `0021` does

The cinematic is two to six seconds of a thirty-second turn, so left alone it
would be charged to the attacker's thinking time and the correct way to play
would be to turn it off. A cinematic you are penalised for watching is not a
feature. So `submit_attack` pushes the deadline by exactly `cn_cine_ms()` of
the swings that were just recorded.

Three things about that, each load-bearing:

- **It is in `submit_attack`, not `cn_attack`.** `cn_attack` holds the rules and
  the bot calls it directly; the bot has no screen and no clock, and giving it
  seconds would be giving it nothing. The turn clock is already `submit_*`'s
  business -- that is where "your time ran out" is raised.
- **There is no "give me more time" call to abuse.** The length is computed
  from the server's own record of the fight. The only way to buy a second is to
  make the server play a longer fight, and the only way to do that is to have
  one. Moving and defending buy nothing, and `12_clock.sql` asserts it.
- **It is capped at twelve seconds**, comfortably above the longest fight that
  can happen today (an eight-parry chain), because abilities are coming and one
  that swings fifty times should not hand its owner a minute to think in.

`cn_cine_ms` is mirrored in the client as `cineMs()` in `src/lib/cine.ts`. The
two have to agree: the server is buying time for a picture the client is
drawing, and if the client's picture runs longer than the server's budget the
player loses their turn watching it. Change a beat length in one, change it in
the other.

### The client half

`src/lib/cine.ts` turns the server's record into a **timeline** -- beats with a
clock, a running health total and a sentence each -- and decides nothing. All
of it is pure: no React, no DOM, no clock of its own, which is what lets four
hundred random fights be checked in node rather than in a browser.

`src/components/Duel.tsx` walks that timeline. It takes the whole screen, the
two of them float and lunge, the health drains, a caption box says what
happened and which rule made it happen, and it is skippable on any click or
key.

Things in there that are load-bearing and look like style until they are not:

- **Health is walked FORWARD from a snapshot taken before the exchange**, never
  back-calculated from what survived. Back-calculation works for the living and
  silently invents a number for the dead -- and the dead are what the last beat
  is about. `Board.tsx` is where the cinematic is built for exactly this
  reason: it already keeps the board a moment ago, because a killed unit is
  gone from `state.units` by the time the fx arrives.
- **Almost nothing is a CSS animation on a class.** A CSS animation starts when
  its class arrives and does NOT restart if the class is already there -- and
  consecutive beats of the same kind are the normal case, not the edge one: a
  parry chain is eight parries in a row. So the lunge, the fall and the camera
  shake go through the Web Animations API, and the parry flash, the ring and
  the damage number are keyed by the beat so React hands each one a fresh
  element. The board's FLIP animation is driven this way for the same reason.
- **Exchanges are QUEUED, not replaced.** The bot acts every 650ms and a fight
  takes seconds, so without a queue its second activation would cut its first
  fight off and show you the aftermath of one you never saw. `Board` also
  reports `onWatching`, and `Match` holds the bot back while a fight is on
  screen.
- **`onDone` is held in a ref and kept out of the schedule's dependencies**, and
  the parent's callback is stable as well. A fresh arrow on any re-render would
  tear down every timer and restart the cinematic from the top -- the blank
  rematch page wearing a different hat.
- Hitstop is **inside** a beat rather than added to it, so it costs no clock and
  cannot accumulate.

Still to build, and deliberately left:

- **Per-ability animations** (the fireball travelling, and so on) and
  status-effect animations. Abilities do not exist yet; they arrive with the
  roster rework, and the beat kinds in `cine.ts` are where they will hang.
- A **full / quick / off setting**. Offered and deferred to Phase D with the
  rest of the settings work. Fire Emblem itself ships one, and by turn forty of
  a long match the case for it will make itself.

### Phase D — UI, i18n, kingdoms

Phase D is thirteen loosely-related items rather than one chunk, so it is being
built in slices. Jared picked the order: **settings plumbing and dark mode
first**, because the dark-mode toggle and the language toggle both need
somewhere per-account to live, and doing it first stops the other two each
inventing their own storage.

#### DONE: settings per account, and dark mode

**`0022_settings.sql` is built and tested (`13_settings.sql`, 32 assertions) and
NOT yet run in production.** One `profiles.settings` jsonb column, one
`set_settings(patch)` function, one trigger.

The design worth remembering is **known keys are validated, unknown keys are
kept**. Each half prevents a different failure. Drop unknown keys and a client
one deploy ahead of the database loses every new setting silently -- and that
is a NORMAL state here, because the site deploys instantly while migrations are
pasted in by hand. Keep everything unvalidated and a volume of 40 or a theme of
'bananas' comes back as a broken screen on every device rather than only on the
one that wrote it. It is a PATCH rather than a replacement for a related
reason: settings are exactly the thing somebody has open in two tabs.

On the client, **the account is the truth and localStorage is the cache in
front of it**. Writes go local-first and are pushed up debounced and coalesced
(a finger on a volume slider is thirty changes a second); the account's copy
wins when it arrives, and whatever the account is MISSING is pushed up once --
which is how anybody who had settings in a browser before 0022 keeps them.
`settings` is deliberately NOT in `useAuth`'s `REQUIRED_COLUMNS`: a database
that has not run 0022 should still let you play, with the cache doing exactly
what it did before.

**Dark mode.** The theme is resolved in JavaScript and stamped on `<html>` as
`data-theme`, so a CSS rule has exactly one question to ask -- 'system' never
reaches the stylesheet. There is an inline script in `index.html` that reads
the same localStorage cache before first paint, because a white flash in front
of somebody who chose dark is the one thing a dark mode must not do.

Two things the measuring settled, and both went against the first instinct:

- **The side colours do not move between themes.** Lifting `--you` for a dark
  background reads better as a line or a tint, and it wrecked the thing they
  are mostly used for -- a SURFACE with white type on it. White-on-blue went
  from 5.9 to 3.2, worse than the same nameplate in light. So they stay put.
  What a brand colour cannot do on near-black is be small text, which is what
  `--you-ink` is for: the same blue, lifted, used only where the blue IS the
  text.
- **A card's `accent` comes out of the database** and was chosen against white;
  some land at 3.8 on near-black. In dark they are mixed toward the page's ink,
  which keeps the card its own colour and the name readable. Light leaves them
  exactly as the card author set them.

Contrast is measured, not eyeballed: every text node's computed colour against
its effective background, composited through transparency, as a WCAG ratio.
**Dark has zero failures. Light has three** -- `.vs`, `.orline` and `.savemark`
-- and all three predate this work. They are listed in the test rather than
silently tolerated: each is a quiet label the palette deliberately keeps quiet,
and changing them is a decision about the brand rather than about dark mode.
**Still open for Jared**, if he wants them lifted.

#### DONE: Spanish

**UI strings** are `src/i18n/en.json` and `es.json`, reached through
`src/lib/i18n.ts`. English is bundled because it is the fallback and a fallback
has to be there before anything is fetched; Spanish is a dynamic import.
`primeLang()` runs at startup so the first paint is not English-then-Spanish. A
missing key renders its own NAME rather than an empty space -- `lobby.play` on
screen is a bug reporting itself, and a blank is a layout that looks fine and
says nothing.

**215 keys, and the checker is the point.** `_to_delete/i18ncheck.cjs` (gone
with `_to_delete`; rebuild it) asserts four things: the same keys both ways,
the same `{holes}` in the same strings, nothing empty and nothing identical in
both languages unless it is on a short list of things that really are, and --
the one that matters -- **every key the CODE asks for exists**. A translation
rots quietly: a key added to English and never to Spanish is hidden by the
fallback and reads fine to the person who wrote it.

**Ability text is in the database**, `cards.ability` (English) and the new
`cards.ability_es`. There is no `ability_en`: `ability` IS the English one and
renaming a column `cn_army`, `deck_of` and `random_deck` all read, to gain a
suffix, is a migration that can only break things. The client looks the text up
LIVE by slug through `useCards()` rather than reading the snapshot in
`matches.state` -- units are snapshotted at deploy and that is right for stats,
but a snapshot cannot hold a translation written after the match began, and
nobody is disadvantaged by a clearer sentence.

**0023 REPLACES the ability prose rather than translating it.** Jared's
instruction was to use what he wrote, in both languages, so both columns are
set from the roster spec in section 6 -- extracted from this file rather than
retyped, with only the `**A:**` / `**P:**` markers stripped (they say whether a
thing is an Ability or a Passive, the Spanish table has no equivalent, and
keeping them would have the two languages saying different amounts).

That replaces prose describing what the engine does today ("Answers a blow from
one tile away or from two") with the spec's description of what each unit is
DESIGNED to do -- and most of those abilities are not built. Dione & Grifo
deals no 15 to everything nearby; Mako plants no bomb. **From 0023 until the
roster rework, a card's text is a promise rather than a description.** That is
deliberate and it is Jared's call; it is written down so nobody later reads it
as a bug.

**The spec's STATS also differ from the live roster**, and 0023 does not touch
them. Lium is 80 hit points here against the spec's 85; Dereo is a 70-point
unit against the spec's 110-point Royal. `14_ability_es.sql` asserts the LIVE
numbers precisely so that a migration claiming to translate cards cannot
quietly retune eleven of them. The stats are the roster rework's business.

Two things the measuring caught that reading did not:

- The theme segment built its key as `settings.theme${value}`, which for a
  value of 'system' asked for `settings.themeSystem` while the dictionary says
  `themeAuto` -- so the button rendered its own key on screen. **No amount of
  checking the dictionaries against each other could see it**, because a
  constructed key is invisible to a search. The keys are written out now.
- A test assertion of mine borrowed Lium's hit points from the spec rather than
  the database, which is how the stat divergence above was found at all.

#### DONE (server half): kingdoms

**`0024_kingdoms.sql` is built and tested but NOT yet run in production.** Two
columns -- `profiles.kingdoms` jsonb (a list of `{id, name, icon, deck}`) and
`profiles.kingdom` text (the selected id) -- plus `save_kingdom`,
`delete_kingdom`, `select_kingdom`, a `cn_clean_kingdoms` cleaner on a trigger,
and `selected_deck()`. `deck_of()` and `set_deck()` are spliced from `0018`.

A list rather than a table, for the same reason settings is a blob rather than
a column each: ten short rows that only their owner reads, always read
together, never joined against anything.

**AN INCOMPLETE KINGDOM IS LEGAL, and that is the whole design.** With one deck
"a team saves itself the moment it is a team" worked. With ten it does not:
building a second kingdom means sitting at one, two, three cards for as long as
it takes to choose, and a store that will not hold that is a store that forgets
what you were doing every time you leave the page. So the column holds a
half-built kingdom happily, and being FIELDABLE is asked separately at the
point of use -- `deck_of()` wants exactly five live cards and exactly one crown
and falls back to the default otherwise. Relaxed editor, strict match.

The one thing `save_kingdom` **does** refuse is a COMPLETE deck that breaks the
royal rule. An incomplete deck has not made its mind up; a complete illegal one
has, and telling somebody the moment they finish beats silently fielding
something else when the match starts.

An unnamed kingdom keeps a **null** name. "Kingdom 3" is words, and which words
they are is a question about the reader's language, so the client answers it --
a default written into the database would be English in a Spanish account
forever.

`profiles.deck` is kept in step rather than retired, written only ever
alongside the kingdoms list. Everything still reading the old column keeps
getting the right answer, `set_deck` writes the SELECTED kingdom, and a client
one deploy behind keeps working. `selected_deck()` falls back to the column for
a profile the backfill missed, which is what `09_combat.sql`'s crownless-deck
assertion now leans on (it empties `kingdoms` alongside the write, because
since 0024 that list is where the truth lives).

#### DONE (client half): kingdoms

`Kingdoms.tsx` (My Kingdom), `KingdomSwitch.tsx` (the pre-battle chip) and
`lib/kingdoms.ts` (the client mirror of 0024's rules). Lobby's team page is now
one line; `Match` takes `onProfile` so the switch works in a waiting room.

**THE ONE RULE THAT DECIDES THE WHOLE SCREEN.** A kingdom becomes the one you
field the moment it IS a kingdom -- five cards and exactly one crown -- whether
that is because you just finished it or because you opened one that already
was. An INCOMPLETE one never displaces a finished one. That is the old "a team
saves itself the moment it is a team" carried up to ten.

The two alternatives were both worse. *Opening a kingdom fields it, full stop*
means wandering into a half-built one silently swaps your army for the default
five -- the exact failure 0024's relaxed-editor/strict-match split exists to
avoid. *A separate "use this one" button* asks a question nobody has: of course
the kingdom you just finished is the one you want. The cost of the rule chosen
is that opening a finished kingdom to look at it does field it, which is why
what you are fielding is written under the grid, on every chip, on the menu
tile, and in the corner of every pre-battle screen.

Other decisions worth not re-litigating:

- **Still no save button.** Everything -- a card, a rename, a mark -- is pushed
  after a 450ms pause, which is also what makes a burst of taps one write.
- **The select waits for the save.** `select_kingdom` on an id the server has
  never seen does not fail; the trigger REPOINTS the selection at the first
  kingdom. So a select that overtakes its own save leaves somebody fielding a
  different army from the one they just built, silently. There is a browser
  assertion for this and it is the one that survived the first mutant.
- **A blank kingdom is never written.** Tapping "new" and wandering off leaves
  nothing behind; the row appears locally because it is what you are looking
  at, and goes up the moment it has a name or a card.
- **The mark** follows the first card in until somebody picks one on purpose,
  and stops being the mark if its card leaves. Chosen from the cards IN the
  kingdom, which is the only list that means anything before anything is
  picked.
- **The switch is absent with one kingdom.** A switch with one position is not
  a switch. It is on ranked, practice, friends and the friends WAITING ROOM --
  `join_match` builds both armies out of `deck_of()`, so an empty room is the
  last instant this can matter -- and on nothing else.
- **`unreadyText()` writes its four `t()` calls out in full** rather than
  building `'kingdom.' + why`. A constructed key is invisible to the check that
  every key the code asks for exists, and this project has already shipped one
  of those (`settings.themeSystem`).

Measured with **121 browser assertions** (`_to_delete/h/kingharness.tsx` +
`kcheck.cjs`, 102; `lobbyharness.tsx` + `lcheck.cjs`, 19) over the shelf, the
save/field call sequences, the mark, deleting, the switch, Spanish, four widths
and WCAG contrast in both themes. Almost all of it is NEW surface, so "run it
against the old code first" does not apply -- **nine mutants** were used
instead, and each one is named by the assertion that caught it: fielding
without checking readiness, saving a blank, no debounce, a select that does not
wait for its save, an eleventh kingdom, a quieter note (contrast), a mark that
ignores a deliberate choice, a switch that shows for one kingdom, and a menu
tile that names an unfieldable kingdom.

#### DONE: the card

**The illustration is no longer drawn on.** Everything used to be cut into the
picture -- the name band across the top corner, the numbers and the rules strip
over the bottom third -- and the stated budget for that was "how much of the art
is hidden", which came to about half. Nothing is cut into it now: a header
above, the square illustration, two strips below. The card is taller than it is
wide as a result, and that is the point -- this is the only place in the app
where the whole drawing is visible. The rules text gets three lines instead of
two, because it is no longer paying for itself in picture. The gradient scrim
that protected white type from a pale patch of sky is gone with the type.

**Pinned left, pointed-at right.** Selecting a unit holds its card open on the
left; whatever is under the pointer opens on the right; pointing at the pinned
unit itself opens nothing. This replaces yours-left/theirs-right, which read
well until a card was pinned and then two of your OWN units wanted the same
edge and one of them lost. Left and right now mean "the one you chose" and "the
one you are pointing at", which is the comparison anybody with two cards open is
making.

**The pinned card drifts** on a nine-second loop; pointing at it settles it into
a tilt picked at random (within 7 degrees) so the same card caught twice is not
a still frame; clicking holds it flat and clicking again lets it go. The float
is an animation on an inner element and the tilt a transition on the outer one,
which is the only arrangement where both work -- an animation's transform beats
a transition on the same element. Reduce-motion starts it still.

**Long press on a phone.** `useLongPress` in Board.tsx, touch pointers only,
420ms, cancelled by 10px of drift; the card lands in the middle of the screen
for as long as the finger is down. The subtle part, and a real bug found by the
browser suite: a swallowed click must be **stopped**, not merely ignored. The
board's own background handler clears the selection, so a click the token
declines to act on but lets past is a long press that puts the unit down. The
assertion for it needs a unit ALREADY selected -- with nothing selected the
escaped click sets the selection to null, which is what it already was, so the
weaker version of the test passed either way.

**Effect icons** were already upper-left and stacking rightward (0019); nothing
to do there but say so.

**The three light-theme contrast failures are fixed**: `.vs` 1.73 and `.orline`
2.07 were `#c4c4d2` and `--faint`, both now `--muted`; `.savemark` 2.31 was
`--good` on white, and `--good` is a SURFACE colour, so there is now a
`--good-ink` beside `--you-ink` -- the same green taken down until it clears 4.5
on both papers, and identical to `--good` in dark, where the bright green is
already 8.1. Running the suite against the previous commit also turned up two
nobody had measured: the card's role line at 2.78 in light (a hard-coded
`#9a9aa8`, now `--muted`) and its rules strip at **1.18 in dark** -- a white
strip painted with `rgba(255,255,255,0.96)` under `--ink`, which in the dark
theme is near-white type on a near-white band. Both are gone with the rewrite.

**How far a card may reach over the board is bounded, not zero.** The arena is
much narrower than the window -- the chat and the log take most of it -- so on
an ordinary desktop the gap beside the board is about 110px, and a card that
fitted in it would be too small to read. So the card is as wide as the gap down
to a 150px floor, and past the floor it reaches a little way over the OUTER
COLUMN and stops. The bound asserted is one tile: it must never reach the
second column, where things actually happen. `.arena` carries `--cols`/`--rows`
for this, because the cards are the board's siblings and cannot read vars set
on it; the gap formula is the board's own width rule negated, so change one and
change both.

Measured with **78 browser assertions** (`_to_delete/h/cardharness.tsx` +
`ccheck.cjs`), which mounts the REAL Match over a faked row rather than the
cards alone -- the thing being changed is not the card but which card opens
where, and that rule lives in Match. **48 of the 78 fail against 1e92233**,
including every geometry claim and `.vs` at exactly the 1.73 it was reported
at, plus four mutants.

The contrast helper had a bug of its own worth recording: `color-mix()` computes
to `color(srgb 0.46 0.53 0.98)`, components in 0..1, and a parser that only knew
`rgb()` read those as bytes and failed a colour that was fine. It failed SAFE,
which is why it survived two slices unnoticed.

#### DONE: the purple words

**There is no keyword table, and that is the whole design.** The roster spec
settled it in one line -- *"text in parentheses is the tooltip number, not part
of the description; the word immediately before it is the purple keyword"* --
and 0023 wrote the spec's sentences into the database verbatim, brackets and
all. So the ability text is ALREADY marked up, and `lib/keywords.ts` reads the
marks out of it:

    "Slightly (5%->10%) increased parry rates"
     ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^
     keyword   its number

A hand-kept list of vague words would exist twice over, once per language, and
would need editing every time a card is retuned in the admin panel -- a deploy
to change a number that lives in a row. Reading the marks out of the sentence
costs nothing, works in Spanish without anybody writing any Spanish, and means
a new card arrives with its own tooltips attached.

**The one exception** is a bracket at the END of a sentence, which is left
exactly as written. Lumea's "choose where to throw them (15s limit)." would
otherwise make a keyword of "them".

**The two languages do not always mark the same word**, because the number does
not always sit in the same place. English says "Slight (25%) chance to strike
twice" and Spanish "Leve probabilidad (25%) de atacar dos veces", so one marks
"Slight" and the other "probabilidad". Dione & Grifo goes further: the Spanish
bracket is at the end of its sentence, so that card has a purple word in
English and none in Spanish. Both are right about their own sentence, which is
all a structural rule can promise, and `kwcheck.cjs` pins it.

**The bubble is a portal** and has to be. Every place a keyword appears is
inside something that clips -- the card's rules strip is line-clamped, the strip
under the board is one line with an ellipsis -- and `position: fixed` does not
rescue it either, because the card carries a transform and is therefore the
containing block for its own fixed descendants.

**Pointer events, not mouse events**, and this was a real bug the browser suite
caught rather than something reasoned out in advance. With mouseenter-to-open
and click-to-toggle, a TAP could never open anything: a tap fires a
compatibility mouseenter first, so the bubble was already open by the time the
click arrived and the click closed it again. Pointer events carry `pointerType`,
so a mouse hovers and a finger presses, and each gets the behaviour it actually
has.

**A peeked card now STAYS UP when the finger lifts**, dismissed by the next tap
anywhere else (a scrim catches it, which also keeps that tap off the board).
That is a reversal of what shipped in 5bfb6f7 and it is not cosmetic: a card
you have to keep a finger on is a card under your finger, and -- the reason it
had to change -- tapping a keyword means letting go first, so on a phone the
purple words were unreachable. A second bug fell out of it: the long press's
click-swallow was only ever consumed by a click on the same token, and with a
scrim in the way that click lands elsewhere, so the flag stayed armed and ate
the NEXT ordinary tap on that unit. It is disarmed on the following pointerdown
now.

On the roster grid in My Kingdom the words are coloured but the number stays in
the sentence: the tile there is itself a `<button>`, so a button inside it would
be invalid and its taps would be the tile's taps. A browsing view keeps
everything visible; the reading view is the card.

Measured with **116 node assertions** (`_to_delete/kwcheck.cjs`, over the real
text of all eleven cards in both languages -- it is a pure string function and
belongs in node) plus **124 browser assertions** (`ccheck.cjs`, up from 78),
against five mutants.

#### DONE (server half): the admin card editor

**Most of the editor already existed.** `profiles.is_admin` has been a column
since 0001, the trigger that stops anybody promoting themselves has been there
since 0001, and so has the RLS policy "admins write cards". 0025 adds no
permission and no new door. What it adds is an answer to "what should an admin
be prevented from doing by accident", and the answers matter more than they
look:

- **Retiring the last royal ends the game.** `deck_of` refuses a crownless deck
  and falls back to `default_deck()`; `default_deck()` is the first five by
  sort, crown or no crown; and the win condition asks whether a side still has
  a royal ON THE BOARD. A roster with no royal is a match that cannot end --
  both armies field five commoners and nobody can lose. One `update cards set
  is_active = false` away, and it does not look like a mistake while you make
  it.
- **Dropping below five active cards** makes every deck in every account the
  wrong length at once.
- **A seven-character hex is not a colour.** `--ink: #ecectf4` was a real typo
  in this project's dark palette; an accent goes from this table straight into
  a style attribute and fails silently on screen.

So 0025 is a BEFORE row trigger (repair what can be repaired -- trim, lowercase
-- refuse the rest with a sentence rather than a constraint name) and a
STATEMENT-level AFTER trigger for the two roster-wide facts, which are
questions about the table after the whole update has landed. Plus the `art`
storage bucket, wrapped in a check for the storage schema so the test harness
-- which fakes only what the migrations need -- still applies the file.

**There is deliberately no function that grants admin.** Only `service_role`
can set the flag, which is what the dashboard's SQL editor runs as:
`update public.profiles set is_admin = true where id = '<uuid>'`. Not even an
admin can make another one. A door nobody needs is a door nobody has to defend.

Two existing tests moved with it, and both moves are the guard proving itself.
`01_rules.sql` used to insert a card with no slug to check the RLS wall
refused it -- the slug guard now refuses it first, so the assertion passed for
the wrong reason and it inserts a valid card instead. `04_roster.sql` used to
retire **Dereo**, the only royal, to test the fallback; that is now refused
outright, so it retires Eva.

#### DONE (client half): the admin card editor

`AdminCards.tsx`, reached by an eighth menu tile that is only drawn for an
account with the flag. That is not the lock -- the lock is the RLS policy on
`cards`, on the server -- but a door drawn for everybody is a door everybody
tries.

**In English only, and with a Save button**, and both are deliberate
departures. Everything else in this app goes through `t()` because everything
else is read by players; this is read by one person, who wrote the Spanish, and
forty dictionary keys nobody will ever render in the other language is forty
things to keep in step for no reader. And My Kingdom saves itself because it is
your own team and a mistake costs one tap; this is the roster every match is
built from, and a stray keystroke in a number field should not be live before
you have finished typing it.

**The server's refusals are shown verbatim.** 0025's messages are sentences
written for whoever is editing the card -- "an accent is six hex digits, like
#2f4bff" is more use than anything this screen could say instead.

Retired cards are listed too, struck through: a retired card is the thing you
come here to bring back. Art goes to the `art` bucket under the card's own
slug, and the crop goes to `<slug>-face.<ext>` because that is where
`faceUrl()` looks -- a convention from 0005 that the editor has to keep rather
than re-open. The full art's URL gets a `?v=` cache-buster, because the URL
does not change when the bytes do and an art fix nobody can see is an art fix
nobody made.

Measured with the lobby suite, now **68 assertions** (up from 25), against five
mutants. Two of them found real bugs in the form rather than confirming it:

- The ten flag checkboxes were a wrapping flex row, ran out of room, and their
  labels overflowed into the neighbour. A grid whose tracks cannot go below
  140px fixed it -- **but the first assertion written for it did not catch it**,
  because text that overflows its box does not move the box. Two rectangles can
  sit politely side by side while their contents are drawn across each other.
- The real cause of that, found by measuring rather than by reading: there is a
  global `input { width: 100% }` near the top of the stylesheet, and a checkbox
  in a flex row obeyed it and became **146px wide**, pushing its own label a
  whole grid track to the right. It read as a wrapping bug and it was a width.
  The assertion that catches it is "every child stays inside its own label",
  which is worth stealing for any other form.

#### DONE: the match-feel trio, and the ladder's two columns

**`0026_trio_and_ladder.sql` is built and tested but NOT yet run in
production.** Three small things that needed the same migration, plus the
ladder.

**WHICH FIVE THEY BROUGHT.** Deployment has been blind since 0008 and most of
that blindness is the point: WHERE the archer is standing is the secret the
phase exists to keep. WHICH FIVE never was, and knowing it is what turns the
phase from a guess into a decision. `their_army()` hands back identity and not
one coordinate, only to a player (a spectator gets nothing -- they could
relay it), and only while the match is still deploying.

It **lists what it returns** rather than subtracting `x` and `y`. Subtracting
the two keys that are secret today leaves every key added tomorrow exposed by
default, and the next field on a unit will be added by somebody thinking about
combat rather than about this function. The test asks what keys came out, not
whether `x` was among them, for the same reason.

**"DEFEAT THE KING."** Black, white, two seconds, once per match, at the moment
it becomes one. It costs two seconds of a thirty-second first turn -- which is
real, and is why it is short and why any key or tap takes the rest back. The
alternative, pushing the deadline the way 0021 pays for the cinematic, is a
migration and a round trip to buy back something a player can take by tapping.
It does NOT play for a match joined mid-way: a title card for a film that is
half over.

**FULL / QUICK / OFF.** A `cine` key in the settings blob -- no column, because
0022's cleaner keeps keys it does not recognise, though 0026 validates it now
that it is a known one. `quicken()` in cine.ts is a pure **re-timing** of a
built cinematic: same beats, same captions, same reductions, moved closer
together, with the squaring-up dropped first because it is the part that
carries no information. `off` means no TAKEOVER, not no feedback -- the board's
own lunge, shake and damage numbers are the half that is information and they
stay whichever way the setting points.

**The clock does not change**, and that is written into the migration because
it looks like an oversight. 0021 pushes the deadline by the full cinematic's
length whatever the setting says, so turning it down hands you that time back
as thinking time -- which is exactly what Skip has done since Phase C shipped.
Computing a different deadline per side would leak a preference into a shared
clock to close a hole that is already open on purpose.

**THE LADDER** grows two columns. The leaderboard view never selected
`avatar`, so `LadderRow` has carried that field with nothing behind it since
0016 -- faces at last. And `tournaments`, Phase E's stat, added now so the
table settles its shape once rather than shifting under everybody later; it
reads a dash for everybody until Phase E fills it, because a column of noughts
reads as a broken feature and a column of dashes reads as a thing that has not
happened yet.

Measured with **25 SQL assertions** (`17_trio.sql`, against four mutants) and
the browser suites, now **329** between them -- ccheck 124 to 148, lcheck 68 to
75.

**The fake server learned realtime.** The board deliberately ignores an `fx`
that was already there when it mounted, because joining a match mid-exchange
must not replay it -- so nothing that reacts to a CHANGE could be tested at
all. `mksite.py`'s shim now keeps a channel registry and exposes
`window.__PUSH(channel, payload)`, and the harness wraps that in
`window.__FIGHT()`. That is what made the cinematic setting testable.

#### Still to do in Phase D

Nothing. Phase D is finished.
- Deployment: you can see **which units** the opponent picked (but not where
  they place them).
- Match start: black box, white text, "Defeat the king." in epic motion.
- Admin card editor (Jared's account only): create / edit / **retire** cards,
  upload token + full art to Supabase Storage. Add `profiles.is_admin` + an RLS
  UPDATE policy on `cards`. In-flight matches keep their snapshot because units
  are copied into `matches.state` at deploy — that is correct, not a bug.
- Ladder: new **tournaments** stat; show everyone's avatar.

### A bug that was live for six migrations: ranked deployment was not blind

Found while reading how a match gets created, on the way into Phase E, and it
is worth writing down in full because of HOW it survived.

0008 made deployment secret, and the mechanism is the important part: during
the phase the two armies are **not in `matches.state` at all**. They live in
`match_deploy`, one row per side, behind `my_deploy()` which hands you only
your own. A policy that merely hid the other side would still have put both
armies in a row that both clients poll, and "you can read it out of the network
tab" is not something a competitive mode may say.

0012 rewrote `ranked_tick` to make who-goes-first a coin flip. It built the
match with `cn_place()` -- which writes both armies straight into
`matches.state` -- and never called `cn_open_deploy()`. **So from 0012 until
0027, ranked matches were not blind.** Friends rooms and practice were never
affected; `join_match` and `create_bot_match` both still open a proper
deployment.

It survived because nothing asserted it on that path. `06_bot_ranked.sql`
checks that the queue pairs people and that the coin is fair; every
blind-deployment assertion in the suite was about rooms. `18_ranked_blind.sql`
now asks the question of **all three ways a match can begin**, in one file, on
purpose -- a rule that is only checked on the path somebody happened to think
about is a rule with a date on it.

And one more lesson, from the fix rather than the bug. The first draft of 0027
RETYPED the queue-insert instead of splicing it, and dropped the `joined_at`
clause that stops a tick from restarting your wait. The suite failed in
`06_bot_ranked.sql` -- a file with nothing to do with the change -- on "nor
with a tab that stopped calling in". Splice, never rewrite from memory; this
project's own rule, caught by this project's own tests.

### Phase E — tournaments (its own project)

Friday Tournaments menu tile, bottom-rightmost. Bracket that sizes itself to
the entrant count, spectating any live match in the tournament, winners wait in
a "waiting" state, leaving counts as a loss and advances the nearest-bracket
winner. Open every day for now; Friday-only later.

### Status effects to build

| Effect | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Burned | Loses 15% HP each time the unit attacks or uses its ability (not its passive) |
| Poisoned | Loses 10% HP each turn |
| Stunned | Cannot attack for a turn |
| Defend | Not an effect, but shares the icon slot: halves incoming damage this turn |

### Rules notes attached to the roster

- **Mist** makes allied Rogues invisible to the opponent. Players must always be
  able to attack empty tiles, so invisible units can be guessed at. A hit
  invisible unit becomes visible: *"[name] was discovered in the Mist!"*. Attacking
  while invisible also reveals.
- **Summons** (tornado, wall, trap) are placed within the summoner's Range.
- **Lumea's tornado**: only when an *opponent* unit steps in does Lumea's
  controller get 15 seconds to choose where to throw it.
- The six units that had no name (Mage A–E, Flying A) are now Ashvar, Velmor,
  Sarrave, Thalgrim, Nyxara and Zephyra. They still use the placeholder art.

## 7. Conventions and gotchas

### Code style

Comments explain **why**, not what, and are written as prose. Where a number is
load-bearing (an animation delay matching a CSS keyframe, a safe-zone
percentage), the comment says where the other half lives so the two move
together. Match the existing voice — it is consistent throughout.

### Things that have bitten before

- **Never cut a CSS range by searching for a stop selector** without reading
  what lies between. Doing this once swallowed a `@media` opener and left a
  stray `}`; Chromium's error recovery then ate `.match { height: 100dvh }` and
  the board vanished in every mode.
- **Counter-skewed elements need horizontal overscale.** A `skewX(8deg)` box of
  height H hides `H·tan8` of its width at each edge. `.rtile-art`, `.rtile-info`
  and `.mtile-art` all carry this; anything new that counter-skews will need it.
- **Postgres will not let you rename an input parameter** with
  `create or replace`. Drop the function and create it (this is why
  `cn_own_half` became `cn_own_side`).
- `cmin` / `cmax` are Postgres system column names. Counter reach is stored as
  `crmin` / `crmax`.
- **Splice, never rewrite from memory.** `deploy_unit` silently lost its swap
  behaviour once because it was reconstructed rather than copied from the
  previous migration and edited.
- FLIP animation is driven by **board coordinates and tile pitch**, never screen
  rects — anything that changes page height would otherwise slide the whole army.
- `useMatch` keeps the old row briefly when `matchId` changes; renders must
  tolerate a stale match for one tick.

### Keeping token cost down (Jared asked about this)

Attached images are re-sent **every turn** for the rest of a session — ten
images is ~11k tokens per turn, which dwarfs even a very long written spec.
So:

1. **Art goes in the repo, not the chat.** Drop files into `public/cards/` and
   name them in the message. Claude reads the file only if it needs to look.
2. **Long specs go in a file too** — this one, or `docs/`. "roster.md is
   updated" costs ~20 tokens; re-pasting the roster costs ~2,000 every turn.
3. Jared's prose is cheap and high-value. Don't ask him to write less.

---

## 8. Still open — ask Jared

1. ~~Damage multiplication order.~~ Confirmed: the proposal in Phase A, built.
2. ~~Parry-chain recursion cap.~~ Confirmed: 8, `cn_parry_cap()`.
3. ~~Exactly one royal per kingdom, or at least one?~~ **Exactly one.** Built.
4. ~~Real names for Mage A–E and Flying A?~~ Invented: Ashvar, Velmor, Sarrave,
   Thalgrim, Nyxara, Zephyra. The roster in section 6 uses them.
5. ~~Forest battlefield background.~~ Dropped — not wanted for now.

6. ~~What counts as one of the two unit-actions, and can one unit spend both?~~
   **A whole activation — move + strike is one.** And **no**: two different
   units. Both built in `0019`.

**PHASE D IS FINISHED.** Settings and dark mode, Spanish, ten kingdoms, the
card rework, the purple words, the admin card editor and the match-feel trio
are all built; the three light-theme contrast failures left open during dark
mode are fixed, and so are two nobody had measured and a SQL test that had been
passing on luck since it was written.

#### THE WHITE SCREEN, and why there is now a crash panel

Reported from a real game: "every time that I attack, then suddenly everything
turns white", on a phone and on a Mac, staying white until a reload. That
sentence describes React unmounting the whole tree after a throw and leaving
the browser's blank page -- and it is the same sentence for EVERY possible
crash, which is what made it expensive. On a phone there is no console to look
in at all.

`Boundary.tsx` catches it: a dark panel naming the error, with the stack, on
screen, selectable, with a Copy button. Two boundaries -- one around the whole
app and one around the match with a way OUT of it, since the lobby is still
standing behind a match that fell over. It is deliberately in English and does
not use the translator: the translator is a hook in a tree that has just proved
it can throw, and a boundary that needs the app to work is not a boundary. The
panel also says out loud that reloading does not forfeit, because the instinct
is that it might -- the board and the clock are both on the server.

Measured against a throw from a render AND a throw from an effect (the
cinematic would have thrown in an effect): panel shown, 0.00 of the screen
white, message readable, in both.

**A boundary is not the fix for whatever threw**, and at the time of writing
the cause is still unknown: a real attack driven through the whole match screen
in a new harness (`matchfx.tsx` -- select, Attack, target, fake server answers
with the fx) survives the ordinary blow, a tree, a kill and all three cinematic
settings, in both themes, with and without reduce-motion. So it depends on live
data the fixtures do not have, and the panel is how the next occurrence will
say which component it was.

**One real bug did fall out of the search.** With reduce-motion on,
`.duel-flash` is a solid white sheet whose only fade-out IS its animation, so
`animation: none` did not calm it down -- it froze it at full opacity over the
fighter for the rest of the exchange. A parry chain measured 15% of the screen
solid white, permanently; it is now `display: none` and measures 0.00, while
ordinary motion still flashes and clears. The lesson is written into the
stylesheet: an element that is nothing but its own disappearance has to be
REMOVED under reduce-motion, not stilled -- and `.duel-pop` right beside it is
the opposite case, pinned visible, because a damage number says something.

#### Phase E -- tournaments: the server half

**`0028_tournaments.sql` is built and tested (`19_tournaments.sql`, 48
assertions, eight mutants) but NOT yet run in production.** The client half is
next.

**THE LIFECYCLE IS A COUNTDOWN FROM THE THIRD ENTRANT.** Sign-ups are always
open -- exactly one `open` tournament exists at a time, enforced by a partial
unique index rather than by everybody remembering -- and nothing happens while
one or two people are in it, because two people who want a match already have
Ranked. The third entrant starts `locks_at`; when it runs out the bracket locks
around whoever is in at that instant, and somebody who joins a second later is
in the next one. Dropping back below three cancels the clock, because the clock
is not a schedule: it is the visible form of "three people are here". An admin
can skip it (`tournament_start_now`), which is the only thing in the file that
asks who you are.

**SEEDING IS BY LP, AND THE BYES ARE FREE.** `cn_bracket_order` builds the
standard bracket order the way it is defined rather than by typing it out, and
two properties fall out of it: the seeds in a first-round pair sum to size+1,
and one of any pair is therefore in the better half. The first gives byes to
the top seeds with no bye-handing-out code anywhere; the second is why a
first-round slot can never be empty of everybody. `19_tournaments.sql` asserts
both over every bracket size from 2 to 64, because they are what the rest of
the file assumes.

**A BYE IS A WIN THAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED** -- recorded the instant the
bracket locks, propagated like any other, so nothing downstream ever asks
whether a slot was won or walked into. A slot whose two sides are both known
builds its match at once, which means two byes meeting each other start playing
before the first round has finished.

**ADVANCEMENT HANGS OFF A TRIGGER ON `matches`.** There are six ways a match
can end -- a king falling in `cn_attack`, `resign_match`, `claim_win`, the
abandon sweep, `force_timeout`'s chain, and the walkover 0028 adds -- and every
one ends with the same UPDATE. Teaching six call sites about brackets would
mean the seventh, written by somebody not thinking about tournaments, stalls a
bracket forever. The test drives advancement through `resign_match` on purpose:
a test that called some `cn_tourney_report()` would prove nothing about the
other five.

**IT IS LP-NEUTRAL.** Tournament matches are `ranked = false`, which is not a
new rule -- `finish_match` is the only thing that touches LP and every caller
already guards it. A cup is its own stat: `profiles.tournaments`, added empty
in 0026, incremented here for the champion only.

**AND THE BRACKET CANNOT STALL**, which is the hardest thing in the file. A
match between two people who have both shut their laptops has, until now,
simply sat there -- nothing in a database moves a clock on its own,
`force_timeout` needs a caller, and both callers have gone. In a friendly room
that is nobody's problem; in a bracket it holds up everybody still playing. So
the tournament page is the referee: `tournament_tick` from ANYBODY, an entrant
or a spectator or somebody two rounds away waiting, pushes every stuck match
along, and a match where both sides have slept through three turns each is
decided for the higher seed rather than left pending. Arbitrary, said out loud
in the log, and the alternative is worse.

#### Still to do in Phase E

- **The client half**: the Tournaments tile (bottom-rightmost), a bracket that
  sizes itself to the entrant count, the countdown, spectating any live match
  in the tournament, and the waiting state between rounds.
- Friday-only. Open every day for now.

0025 is run and the flag is set, so the Cards tile is live. Nothing in the app
can set `is_admin` -- only `service_role`, which is what the dashboard's SQL
editor runs as -- so a second admin is a second `update public.profiles set
is_admin = true where id = '<uuid>'` and nothing else.

One thing is waiting on Jared rather than on code: the site has to be
**deployed** for any of the Phase C client to be visible. `./deploy.sh` from an
ordinary terminal. Everything it needs is already live in the database.
