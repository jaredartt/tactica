 * from: the two views share nothing, and React swaps one for the other in a
 * single frame, which reads as the screen glitching rather than as going
 * somewhere.
 *
 * So a leaning block sweeps across, the swap happens while it covers the
 * screen, and it carries on out the far side. Same skew as the menu, so the
 * whole app moves in one shape.
