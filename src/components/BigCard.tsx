 * one card in the middle of the screen for as long as the finger is down.
 *
 * Pinned-left and hovered-right rather than yours-left and theirs-right, which
 * is what this was before ten kingdoms' worth of cards ago. The old rule read
 * well until a card was pinned, and then two of your own units wanted the same
 * edge and one of them lost. Left and right now mean "the one you chose" and
 * "the one you are pointing at", which is exactly the comparison anybody

 * it settles it into a tilt picked at random, so the same card caught twice
 * does not look like a still frame. Clicking it stops all of that and leaves it
 * flat, and clicking again lets it go; a card you are reading carefully should
 * be a card that holds still when you ask it to.
 *
 * The float is on an inner element and the tilt is on the outer one, which is
 * the only arrangement where both work: an animation's transform beats a
 * transition on the same element, so a tilt applied to the floating element
 * would jump between frames instead of easing.
