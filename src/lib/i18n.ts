/**
 * The interface, in two languages.
 *
 * The split is the one decided in Phase D and it is worth restating, because
 * the two halves live in different places for different reasons:
 *
 *   UI STRINGS live in this repo, as JSON. They are versioned with the code
 *   that uses them, they cost no database read, and a screen that is late to
 *   load its words is a screen that flashes English at a Spanish reader.
 *
 *   ABILITY TEXT lives in the DATABASE, in cards.ability / cards.ability_es.
 *   A balance tweak rewrites an ability every time, and if that text were in
 *   the repo every tweak would need a deploy -- which defeats the live card
 *   editor the admin panel is meant to become.
 *
 * English is bundled because it is the fallback and the fallback has to be
 * there before anything is fetched. Spanish is a dynamic import: it is a few
 * kilobytes nobody reading English should have to download, and the moment a
 * third language appears that argument only gets stronger.
 *
 * A missing key renders its own name rather than an empty space. An empty
 * space is a layout that looks fine and says nothing; `lobby.play` on screen
 * is a bug reporting itself.
