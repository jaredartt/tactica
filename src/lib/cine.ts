 * decided by Postgres and is being read back, which is the same relationship
 * rules.ts has to the board.
 *
 * All of it is pure. No React, no DOM, no clock of its own: a timeline is a
 * value, and a value can be checked in node against four hundred random
 * fights, which is exactly what it is.
 *
 * The translator is INJECTED rather than imported, and that is what keeps the
 * above true: importing i18n would drag the settings store, the dictionaries
 * and a dynamic import into a module whose whole value is that it can be run
 * with nothing around it. A caller has a `t` already; handing it over costs
 * one argument.
