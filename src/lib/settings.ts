/**
 * Sound, motion and the theme.
 *
 * These used to be three numbers in localStorage, and the old comment here
 * defended that: nothing another device needs to know, and a volume slider
 * that waits for a round trip feels broken. Half of that still holds. The
 * other half stopped holding the moment a THEME joined them -- signing in on a
 * phone and getting a white screen because the preference stayed on the laptop
 * is not a cache miss, it is the setting not working.
 *
 * So the account is the truth and localStorage is the cache in front of it.
 * The slider still moves instantly, the page still paints the right colours
 * before anything has been fetched, and the account is what makes it true on
 * the next device. Writes go local-first and are pushed up debounced; the
 * account's copy wins when it arrives.
 *
 * A module-level store rather than context, because the settings panel, the
 * sound player, both transitions and the cinematic all read it, and most of
 * those are not React components.
