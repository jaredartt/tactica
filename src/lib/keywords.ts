/**
 * The purple words, and where their numbers come from.
 *
 * THERE IS NO KEYWORD TABLE, and that is the whole design. The roster spec
 * already settled this in one line -- "text in parentheses is the tooltip
 * number, not part of the description; the word immediately before it is the
 * purple keyword" -- and 0023 wrote the spec's sentences into the database
 * verbatim, parentheses and all. So the ability text is already marked up:
 *
 *     "Slightly (5%->10%) increased parry and crit rates."
 *      ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^
 *      keyword   its number
 *
 * A hand-kept list of vague words would have to exist twice over -- once per
 * language -- and would have to be edited every time Jared retunes a card in
 * the admin panel, which is a deploy to change a number that lives in a row.
 * Reading the marks out of the sentence costs nothing, works in Spanish
 * without knowing any Spanish, and lets a new card arrive with its own
 * tooltips already attached.
 *
 * THE ONE EXCEPTION is a parenthetical at the END of a sentence. Lumea's
 * "choose where to throw them (15s limit)." would make a keyword of "them",
 * which is nonsense; in every card that really means a keyword the number sits
 * mid-sentence, qualifying the word in front of it. So a parenthetical with
 * nothing after it but a full stop is left exactly as written, and reads as
 * the aside it is.
 *
 * A consequence worth knowing: the two languages do not always mark the same
 * word, because the number does not always sit in the same place. English says
 * "Slight (25%) chance to strike twice" and Spanish says "Leve probabilidad
 * (25%) de atacar dos veces", so one highlights "Slight" and the other
 * "probabilidad". Both are the word the number qualifies in their own
 * sentence, which is the only thing this can promise.
